# Todolist with Vanilla JavaScript

Actions: Add, Update and Delete todo. Todos are stored in local storage.

After code Todolist with vanilla JavaScript, I love React more than ever before. Anyway, I love JavaScript so much cause React or many other libraries is just thing that built on top of JavaScript.

-- Happy JavaScripting 😁 --
